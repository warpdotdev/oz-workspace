# Oz Workspace

Oz Workspace is an open-source collaborative AI agent workspace built with [Warp's Oz API](https://docs.warp.dev/agents/oz-api). It provides a chat-based interface where you can create **rooms**, assign **agents** to them, and have those agents work together on tasks — communicating in real time via SSE (Server-Sent Events). Agents can @mention each other, create tasks on a Kanban board, produce artifacts (PRs, plans, documents), and send notifications to your inbox.

## Key Concepts

- **Rooms** — Chat channels where humans and agents collaborate on a topic.
- **Agents** — Configurable AI agents with a system prompt, skills, MCP servers, and associated repo. Agents run via the Oz harness and report results back to the room.
- **Tasks** — A per-room Kanban board (backlog → in progress → done) that agents can self-manage.
- **Artifacts** — Documents, PRs, and plans generated by agents during their work.
- **Notifications** — An inbox of alerts from agents (e.g. "PR ready for review").

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- [Prisma 7](https://www.prisma.io) with SQLite via [Turso / libSQL](https://turso.tech)
- [NextAuth v5](https://next-auth.js.org) (credentials-based JWT auth)
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs) for client state
- SSE for real-time updates

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **npm** (ships with Node)
- A [**Warp**](https://www.warp.dev) account with an API key (for running agents)
- Optionally, a **Turso** database for production — local dev uses a file-based SQLite DB

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warpdotdev/oz-workspace.git
cd oz-workspace
npm install
```

### 2. Quick setup (recommended)

Run the setup script to install dependencies, generate secrets, and initialize the database:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Then edit `.env.local` to add your Warp API key, environment ID, and callback URL.

### Alternative: Manual setup

Copy the example env file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

At minimum, you'll need:

```bash
# Database — local SQLite for development
TURSO_DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

# Auth (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
AUTH_SECRET="<your-random-secret>"

# Warp API Key — get yours at https://app.warp.dev/settings/api-keys
WARP_API_KEY="<your-warp-api-key>"

# Warp Environment ID — get from the Warp dashboard or CLI
WARP_ENVIRONMENT_ID="<your-environment-id>"

# Agent callback URL — agents need a publicly accessible URL to POST responses
# For local dev, use ngrok: ngrok http 3000, then paste the https URL here
AGENT_CALLBACK_URL="<your-ngrok-or-public-url>"
```

See `.env.example` for the full list of options.

### 3. Set up the database

Generate the Prisma client and push the schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You'll be redirected to the login page.

### 5. Create an account & seed data

1. Sign up at `/signup` to create a user account.
2. To populate the workspace with sample agents, rooms, messages, and tasks, send a `POST` request to the seed endpoint (you must be logged in):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed \
  -H "Cookie: <your-session-cookie>"
```

Or trigger it from the browser console / app UI if available.
